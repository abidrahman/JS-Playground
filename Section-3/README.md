# Notes from Section 23

### Primitive Types: 
 - Something that represents a SINGLE value
 - JS has six primitive types:
    - Undefined
    - Null
    - Boolean
    - Number
    - String
    - Symbol

### Operators
 - Operators are just functions.
 - Infix notation: The operator sits in between the two variables. 
    ```
     3 + 4
    ```
 - Equality vs Strict Equality
    - Equality tries to coerce the variables.
    ``` 
    0 == false; true
    0 === false; false
    ```

- Coersing for input arguments
    ```
    name = undefined || "<Your name here>";
    // name = "<Your name here>"
    ```
